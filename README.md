# 🚀 Challenge - JEE and Java Server Pages (I) 🚀
In this challenge, we will validate our knowledge in using Java Server Pages (JSP) together with the Eclipse IDE. To tackle this challenge, you will need to apply everything learned in units 1, 2, and 3 of this module. We recommend keeping this material handy in case of any doubts.

Read through the entire document before starting the individual development of this challenge to ensure you achieve the maximum score and focus your efforts effectively.

Time Allocation: 1 hour.

# 🛠️ Description 🛠️
In this challenge, we will develop a new Dynamic Java Web Project. The main feature of this project is to select a number on the screen, and then our project, using a servlet, will respond with the following actions related to the selected number:

Return the factorial of the number.
Indicate whether the number is even or odd.
For this, we will rely on both JSP for displaying information and Java Servlets for capturing the data and returning values based on the user's selection.

# 🌐 Let's Build! 🌐
Using the concepts and tools learned so far, we will generate the following:

A Dynamic Java Web Project using the Eclipse IDE.
One JSP file for capturing the selected number value (from 1 to 10).
Integration with a Servlet to handle the request and process the selected number with appropriate responses.
Generate responses with values based on the selected number.
You can do it!

# 📋 Requirements 📋
Using the Eclipse IDE, you must create a new Dynamic Web Project called "DesafíoJSP". This project should be deployed under the Apache Tomcat 9 web server.

Once the project is created, you need to create an "index.jsp" page, which is the entry JSP page where you will display a list of numbers from 1 to 10 on the screen. These numbers should have links associated with them, which will be sent as parameters to the corresponding servlet. For example: <a href="servlet?num=1">Number 1</a>.

You need to create a servlet capable of collecting the information sent from the JSP (request of the day), processing the data, and providing the required output, specifically the two indicated processes:

Return the factorial of the number.
Indicate whether the number is even or odd.
Finally, this servlet should be able to display the output on the screen for the user to see.

# 🎯 Tasks 🎯
Task 1: Create a new Dynamic Java Web Project named “DesafioJsp”.

Points: 1
Task 2: Create the corresponding JSP structure for the required view, considering the necessary output and links (calling a servlet with the number parameter to return factorial/even-odd status).

Points: 3
Task 3: Create and link the necessary servlets for displaying the required information (2 servlets).

Points: 3
Task 4: Show the output information according to the two required processes: factorial and whether the number is even or odd.

Points: 3
# Good luck and success! 🚀
